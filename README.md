## Problem
1. Current caregiver-physician communication methods
  - Different health care providers have different diagnoses of ASD based on the child's symptoms.
  - Difficult to follow-up to daily life data outside of hospital treatment hours
2. Current caregiver-therapist communication style
  - Each uses a different app to send and receive information

There is a need for **standardized and efficient information sharing** on problem behavior.


## Solution
Children with autism spectrum show more problematic behaviors than other groups in terms of frequency and severity. Typical problem behaviors include anger attacks, hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, self-harm behavior, and stereotyped behavior.
- **AS-IS**: The evaluation method for problem behavior is in the form of a report by parents through questionnaires.
- **TO-BE**: Through the mon-ami mobile app, problem behavior data can be efficiently recorded/managed, and even daily life data can be followed-up.

Digitization of daily records of ASD patients
- Step1: Registration, write down basic development information for children
- Step2: Select and add symptoms to record, upload text, photos, and videos daily
- Step3: View analysis report for uploaded data by period, symptom, and frequency
